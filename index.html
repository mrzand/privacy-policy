        data in line with legal, regulatory, financial and good-practice
        requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. The period for which we may retain your personal data will depend
        on the type of personal data collected, the purposes for which it was
        collected, applicable limitation periods for the exercise of legal
        rights and whether any legal or regulatory obligations require the
        retention of the personal data.

              for Android devices, called a Google Advertising ID (AAID).
              These Tracking IDs enable app providers and advertisers to track
              user activity and target ads at those users.

        VI.
        <strong>PRACTICES REGARDING EXTRA-EEA TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL DATA</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        1. We will not transfer your personal data outside of the EU, except
        as set out in paragraph 6 above, for example if we utilise cloud-based
        platforms to store personal data, which may involve use of
        geographically distributed data centres.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. In the case of these extra-EU transfers, where the transfers are
        not to countries that provide an adequate level of protection, we will
        put in place appropriate safeguards to cover transfers of personal
        data including, for example, signing standard contractual clauses,
        relying on a Privacy Shield certification and/or data protection
        clauses adopted by the European Commission.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. If there are any other circumstances which would require us to
        transfer personal data outside of the UK, we will seek your consent to
        transfer your personal data outside of the UK.
      </p>
      <p>VII. <strong>THIRD PARTY WEBSITES</strong></p>
      <p>
        Our Platform may contain links to third party websites. If you follow
        a link to a third-party website, please note that this Privacy Policy
        does not apply to those websites. We are not responsible or liable for
        the privacy policies or practices of those websites, so please check
        their policies before you submit any personal data to those websites.
      </p>
      <p>VIII. <strong>SECURITY</strong></p>
      <p>
        1. We take data security seriously. We implement and maintain
        appropriate technical and organisational measures including resilient
        security systems and protocols to protect the personal data we store.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. We have put procedures in place to deal with any suspected data
        security breach and will notify you and applicable regulator of a
        suspected breach where the breach may cause a risk to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof
        of identity before we are able to disclose personal data to you.
      </p>
